<p> Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed
to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose
programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere
 (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
  Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically
  compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless
   of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C
    and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java
  runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code
  modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
   As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according
    to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21] </p>
